		   		I design and build furniture from formed and repurposed materials, I also work in interior design. I have always had a fascination with furniture and built my first table from reclaimed kauri 4 years ago for the bach in Raglan. My first effort resulted in a flurry of orders. With the will and the skill but lack of a formal workshop I managed to complete the orders in the woolshed with equipment russelled up from toolboxes around the sheds. A few sold quickly in one of Ponsonby’s top design stores. I then returned to my job in London as a project manager for interior fitouts of restaurants, shops and offices.

		   		Akau Raglan has always been a place of interest and while i've been away for a while it's nice to have seen it grow in its popularity over the years but still keep its strong nit community and surf town values, it's NZs coolest little town!! Best coffee, best waves, best town! Raglan has got a bit of everything! It’s obvious to see by the hordes of cars heading up or down for the weekends.
